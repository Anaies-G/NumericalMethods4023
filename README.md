# Root-Finding Methods in MATLAB

This repository contains implementations of various numerical root-finding methods in MATLAB. The main script is `app.m`, and each method has its own function file.

## Available Methods

1. Bisection Method 
2. False Position Method 
3. Fixed-Point Iteration 
4. Newton-Raphson Method 
5. Secant Method 

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory
3. Run `app.m` to execute the main script

## File Structure

- `app.m` - Main script that demonstrates all methods
- `bisection.m` - Bisection method function
- `false_pos.m` - False position method function
- `fixed_point.m` - Fixed-point iteration function
- `newton.m` - Newton-Raphson method function
- `secant.m` - Secant method function
- `gvalid.m` and `rfinder.m` some other functions
- `report.pdf` Report file in Persian

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2018b or later
